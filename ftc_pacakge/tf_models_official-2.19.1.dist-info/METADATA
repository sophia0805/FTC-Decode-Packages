Dynamic: summary

The TensorFlow official models are a collection of
models that use TensorFlow's high-level APIs.
They are intended to be well-maintained, tested, and kept up to date with the
latest TensorFlow API. They should also be reasonably optimized for fast
performance while still being easy to read.
